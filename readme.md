# Area

Hi. This gem allows you to extract a region in the United States from an area code. Area uses public data and does not rely on any external services or have any dependencies.

## Usage

In your gemfile: `gem 'area'`

In your code: `646.to_region #=> NY`

### Testing and Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome. I'm testing with minitest.
